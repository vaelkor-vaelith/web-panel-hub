  EVERY KINGDOM BELIEVES
  Unlockable Track - The Shattered Dominion
============================================================

  Style: Solo oud + four tribal soloists, no percussion
  Tempo: 58 BPM | Key: A minor
  The speed of breathing when you're trying not to cry.

  Unlocked after winning at least one game with each of
  the four tribes. Because you cannot hear this song until
  you have fought as all four. Until you have been the hero
  and the villain in every configuration.

I learned the truth the night they came
With holy light and righteous flame
They burned my mother's hands for stealing bread
And sang a hymn while she bled

So do not speak to me of mercy
Mercy is a word the fed
Teach to the hungry

I know what kindness looks like
From the underneath

I held a dying soldier - not mine, theirs
Shadow blade still wet inside his chest
He whispered "tell them I was brave"
I lied and said the light would let him rest

What else do you want from me
I know the prayer is empty
I say it anyway
Because the boy was seventeen
And someone had to say
That it mattered
That he was here
That any of us were here at all

They call me destroyer
Like I chose the burning
Like I wasn't the first thing the flame consumed

I loved a garden once
I loved a house with a door that didn't lock
Because we trusted the road
Then the road brought soldiers
Wearing Light
Wearing Earth
Wearing reasons

I didn't learn to burn
I learned that nothing you love
Is safe from someone else's
Belief
That they deserve it more

They tell me I am stubborn
That I hold too tightly to the dirt
But you have never buried a child
In soil you raised them from
And been told that the ground
Belongs to someone else now
Because their god said so

I do not hate the fire
I do not hate the shadow
I hate that they believe
As deeply as I do
And only one of us can be right

...can we

What if your light is my darkness wearing white
What if my mercy is just fear that learned a name
What if I burned the only thing that could have saved us
What if the ground I'm standing on is someone's grave

We made the war because we loved something
Every single one of us
Loved something so deeply
That we could not bear the world
Where it was not the only truth

And so we burned each other's truths
And called it justice
And called it survival
And called it necessary
And called it holy

And the children learned the songs
And the children raised the flags
And the children
Grew into us

Every kingdom believes it is the kingdom that was wronged.
