============================================================


[OPENING - pipe organ, single D major chord (0:00-0:12)]


[VERSE 1 - solo soprano, warm, motherly (0:12-0:50)]
Before the fire
Before the blade
Before the shadow learned to trade
There was a light
And it was ours
Not taken - given
Not demanded - shared

We opened our hands before the world had language
And said here
Here is warmth
Here is sight
Here is the name of every star

We asked for nothing
We have never asked for anything
And still they turned away


[VERSE 2 - choir enters, unison (0:50-1:20)]
We built the hospitals
We wrote the laws
We buried the dead who cursed our name
With the same hands that healed the living
And we wept for both equally

Do you understand
We wept for both


[VERSE 3 - choir four-part harmony builds (1:20-1:55)]
We did not come to your shores with chains
We came with medicine
We did not tear down your temples
We opened our doors and let you see
What worship looks like
When it isn't afraid

And you call that conquest
You call that pride
You look at the cathedral
And see a cage


[CHORUS - full organ, all stops, church bell rings (1:55-2:20)]
But the door is open
The door has always been open
We would never lock it
Why would we lock it
Where would you go
That isn't darker than where we brought you


[BRIDGE - soprano alone, organ softens, voice breaks (2:20-3:00)]
This is the part you will not hear
This is the part that breaks my voice

I did not want an empire
I wanted a family
I wanted to hold the broken thing
And feel it heal beneath my hands
And hear it say thank you

Not because I needed the words
But because the words would mean
It understood
That it was loved

Is that so wrong
To want the wounded world to know it's loved


[VERSE 4 - organ returns, choir hums beneath (3:00-3:30)]
And if it will not know
If it bites the hand
If it calls the healer "tyrant"
And the shelter "prison"
And the hymn "a weapon"

Then I will sing louder
I will build the shelter stronger
I will heal the hand that strikes me
And I will not stop
I will never stop

Because stopping would mean
The darkness was right
And I cannot live in that world
I am not built for that world


[VERSE 5 - building, choir full harmony (3:30-4:00)]
You think my certainty is arrogance
But you have never carried what I carry
The weight of knowing what is good
And watching the world choose otherwise
Every single day

And choosing to show up anyway
With open hands
With open doors
With one more hymn
One more dawn
One more chance


[CHORUS 2 - all stops pulled, choir + bell (4:00-4:25)]
I will give you chances until I die
And after I die
The ones I taught will give you more

Light is not a request
Light is not a debate
Light is the thing that happens to a room
When someone strikes a match

You can argue with the flame
But the room is already brighter
And you cannot un-see what was shown to you


[VERSE 6 - organ sustains, soprano resolute (4:25-4:50)]
So hate us if you must
Hate the warmth
Hate the sight
Hate the hand that reached for you
When no one else would

But know this
And carry it with you into whatever dark you choose


[FINAL - strips back to solo voice, bell rings alone (4:50-5:30)]
The dawn was ours to give
We gave it freely
And we will give it again tomorrow
And the day after
And the day after that

Until the world is bright enough
That it no longer needs us

And on that day
We will rest
And we will be glad

But not today
Not today

There is still so much dark
And we have so much light to give
