============================================================


[INTRO - solo voice, no instruments, 4 bars]

Ash to ash, throne to throne
The light that fell still lights the bone


[VERSE 1 - voice + cello drone + soft percussion like a distant war drum]

We were born beneath a shattered sky
Where the old gods bled and the new ones lie
Every kingdom carved from a single wound
Every flag we raise is a stolen rune


[PRE-CHORUS - strings swell, second voice enters in harmony]

And the fire knows your name
And the earth will stake its claim
And the shadow trades in blame
But nothing dies the same


[CHORUS - full orchestra + choir]

Ashes remember what the living forget
Every war we wage is the first one yet
Lay your cards where the broken gods wept
Ashes remember - ashes remember


[VERSE 2 - pulled back slightly, voice + strings + war drum steady]

Light will promise what it cannot keep
Shadow sells you secrets in your sleep
Fire will love you till there's nothing left
Earth will hold you down until your death


[PRE-CHORUS - building again, choir hums underneath]

And the throne has no king
And the sword has no swing
And the prayer has no wing
But we play - we play - we play


[CHORUS - FULL, louder than before, choir prominent]

Ashes remember what the living forget
Every war we wage is the first one yet
Lay your cards where the broken gods wept
Ashes remember - ashes remember


[BRIDGE - everything drops except a solo piano and the voice, intimate and raw]

I had a name before the Shattering
I had a home before the scattering
Now I'm just a card in someone's hand
Played and spent across a burning land


[FINAL CHORUS - full orchestra + choir + war drums + solo voice cutting through]

Ashes remember what the living forget
Every war we wage is the first one yet
Lay your cards where the broken gods wept
Ashes remember - ashes remember


[OUTRO - everything falls away. Solo voice alone, almost whispered, over silence.]

Ash to ash... throne to throne...
We play the game... to find our way home.
