  THE GROUND REMEMBERS
  Ironbark Bastion - Earth's Anthem
============================================================

  Style: Solo cello (open D tuning), stones, hurdy-gurdy
  Voice: Male baritone, quarried, ancient-dense
  Tempo: 50 BPM | Key: Open D (bare fifth, no third)
  No drums. Earth doesn't keep time.
  "The tempo of roots growing. The tempo of stone cooling."

============================================================


[OPENING - cello alone, open D string drone (0:00-0:25)]


[FIRST MOVEMENT - voice enters over drone (0:25-1:15)]
They ask me why I will not move
As if moving were a virtue
As if the river that abandons its bed
Is braver than the stone that stays

I have watched the river
I have seen where it goes
It goes everywhere
It arrives nowhere
And it calls this "freedom"

I call it forgetting

I do not forget


[SECOND MOVEMENT - the story of Edric (1:15-2:10)]
There is a boy buried thirty steps from where I stand
His name was Edric
He was nine
He could not lift his father's shield
But he stood behind it when the fire came
And the fire came

And after the fire
The light came
With bandages and hymns
And they healed the survivors
And they built a school where his house had been
And they taught his sisters new songs
And within a year
No one in the village could remember
The song his mother used to sing

Except the ground
The ground remembers


[THIRD MOVEMENT - conviction (2:10-2:50)]
This is what none of them understand
Not the shadow with its clever knives
Not the light with its open hands
Not the fire with its hungry mouth

They think the world is something you do
I know the world is something you hold

You hold it the way you hold a child
Who is too sick to stand
You do not carry them toward something better
You sit with them where they are
And you do not leave

That is not poetry
That is Tuesday
That is every day I have ever lived


[FOURTH MOVEMENT - hurdy-gurdy enters (2:50-3:30)]
They call me stubborn
They are right
They say it like it is a flaw
Like the mountain should apologize
For being in the way

I am in the way
I have always been in the way
I will be in the way long after
The armies have rusted
And the treaties have yellowed
And the gods have been forgotten
By the people who made them

I did not make gods
I made walls
I made roots
I made graves that stay where you put them

And yes
They are graves
I know what I am standing on
I have always known

You think I hold this ground because I love it
You are half right
I hold this ground because it holds my dead
And I will not walk away from my dead
For your progress
For your freedom
For your dawn
For your revolution

You can offer me the whole horizon
I will take this field


[FIFTH MOVEMENT - emotional center (3:30-4:15)]
Because this field has a name
And the name is every person
Who trusted me enough to die here

Do you understand what land is
Not territory
Not resource
Not strategic position

Land is a promise
That someone will remember where you fell

And I am the promise

I am the one who remembers
When the fire has moved on to the next burning
When the light has moved on to the next saving
When the shadow has moved on to the next scheme

I am still here
In the same field
With the same hands
Saying the same names
Every morning

Edric
Maren
Tobas
Yreth
Clay

I say them so the wind carries them
I say them so the ground knows
It has not been abandoned


[SIXTH MOVEMENT - building (4:15-4:55)]
They tell me the world is changing
I know
I have watched it change
Nine hundred times
It always changes back

The names are different
The fire is the same
The light is the same
The shadow is the same

Only the ground is different
Because the ground gains
One more name
Every time

And I hold them all

You want to know why I will not move
Why I build the wall higher instead of building a road out
Why I teach my children to stand instead of to run
Why I plant trees that I will never sit beneath

Because someone has to be the place
That does not move
When everything else does

Someone has to be the ground
That the fleeing child runs toward
Not because it is safe
Nothing is safe
But because it is there
When nothing else is

I am not brave
I am not wise
I am not kind

I am present

And in a world that burns and heals and steals and forgets

Present
Is the most radical thing
A person can be


[FINAL MOVEMENT - the names return (4:55-5:45)]
So I will stand here
Where Edric fell
Where Maren planted the oak that shades his stone
Where Tobas built the wall that held for thirty years
Where Yreth sang the song the light tried to replace
Where Clay - small, quiet Clay -
Died with dirt in his hands
Because he was planting when the soldiers came
And he did not stop planting

He did not stop

And neither will I

The ground remembers what the world does not
That someone stood here
That someone stayed
That someone chose the field over the horizon
And called it enough

And it was

It was enough
