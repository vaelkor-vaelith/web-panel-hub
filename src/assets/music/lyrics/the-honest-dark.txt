============================================================
  THE HONEST DARK
  Shadow's Anthem - The Shattered Dominion
============================================================

  Style: Bass guitar, prepared piano, dry vocal, distant snare
  Tempo: Slow prowl | Key: C# minor (unresolved)
  The sound of someone circling a room.

  This is not a hymn. This is a closing argument.
  Shadow didn't write lyrics - it wrote a confession
  that indicts everyone listening.

============================================================


[OPENING - bass guitar alone, chromatic walk: C#, D, D#, back to C#. 15 seconds of prowling.]

(no vocals - let the listener sit in the dark)


[VERSE 1 - voice enters mid-phrase, low, almost spoken, bass drops to sustained note]

You built your thrones on pretty words
And made the poor applaud
You wrote the laws in golden ink
And signed them "will of God"

I watched
I waited
I took notes


[VERSE 2 - voice gains an edge, sharper consonants, bass chromatic walk returns faster, prepared piano enters]

You think the dark is where the monsters live
You're right
But you made us
Every single one of you made us

With your clean hands and your closed doors
And the jobs you needed done
But couldn't name out loud

We are the invoice you never paid
We are the hand you shook at midnight
And denied at dawn


[CHORUS - controlled melody, four notes, narrow range, bass and piano together]

So call me thief
Call me liar
Call me the shadow on your holy wall

But I have never killed a man
And told his children it was justice
I have never burned a village
And called the ashes "peace"

I just killed him
And I left

And you hate me for that
Not for the killing
For the honesty


[VERSE 3 - the indictment, rhythmic and percussive, bass mirrors each accusation]

Your Light says love
While its armies march
Your Fire says freedom
While the forests choke
Your Earth says patience
While the hungry wait
And wait
And wait
Until the waiting kills them quieter than any blade I own


[BRIDGE - snare enters, one dry crack every four beats, voice softens for the first time]

They sent their children to my streets
The ones the temples wouldn't feed
The ones the armies wouldn't take
The ones the farmlands couldn't keep

They came to me with empty hands
I didn't give them prayers
I gave them knives
And they survived

Is that not mercy?
I'm asking

When the Light wouldn't feed them
And the Earth wouldn't hold them
And the Fire wouldn't warm them

I opened a door in the dark
And said "come in, it's ugly in here, but it's warm,
and no one will lie to you"

Is that not a kind of love?


[VERSE 4 - voice retreats to conversational tone, bass returns to opening chromatic walk]

You'll never call it that
I know

You need me to be the villain
So your story makes sense
So your songs have a shadow to push against
So your children know what darkness looks like
And never notice it in the mirror

That's fine
I've been your monster long enough
To know that monsters serve a purpose

But sometimes
Late at night
When the treaties are signed
And the prayers are said
And the fires have cooled
And the ground is still

I wonder if any of you remember
Who did the work
That let you sleep


[VERSE 5 - quiet resignation]

You won't sing songs about us
You won't carve our names in stone
But every throne that stands tonight
Stands on a grave we dug alone


[OUTRO - everything strips down, just bass and voice, as it was in the beginning]

So yes
I live in the dark
But I chose it
Eyes open
Hands dirty

Heart - and you will never believe this -
Honest

The dark is not the absence of your light
The dark was here first
And it will be here last

And it has never once
Not once
Pretended to be something
It wasn't


(Bass plays one final C#. Sustains. Decays naturally.
 No reverb. No tail. It simply becomes quiet,
 and then it's gone.)
