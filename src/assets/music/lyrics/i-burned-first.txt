================================================================================

I want you to know
Before the heat comes
Before the air turns
Before you see me as the monster
In the story you'll tell your children

I want you to know
That I can see you
That I know what this is
That I know what you built here
And it is beautiful

The stone you carried from the river
The door your father hung
The garden where your daughter learned the word for rain
I see it
I have always seen it

I am not blind
That is my punishment
I see everything I burn

Do you think I came here hungry
Do you think I woke this morning
And chose destruction like a garment
Put on fury like a coat

I woke this morning
And I held my hands over the cookfire
And I watched the flames
And I said
Not today
Please
Not today

But the fields to the south are choking
And the river has not moved in seven years
And your walls - your beautiful walls -
Have kept the rot inside as much as they kept the danger out
And the children in the eastern quarter
Have not seen sunlight
Because the canopy your ancestors planted with such love
Has grown so thick
That love itself has become the ceiling
That holds them down

And no one will cut it
Because it was planted with love
And who burns a thing that was planted with love

I do
God help me
I do

Not because I hate the tree
But because I love the children
More than I love the tree
And you will never forgive me for that arithmetic

This is what they will never write about us
In the histories
In the songs
In the accounts of who did what to whom

They will write that fire came
They will not write that fire wept

They will write that the city burned
They will not write the hour I stood at the gates
Arguing with myself
Begging myself
To find another way

There is no other way
I have looked
I have spent lifetimes looking
Light tried to heal the rot and the rot healed around the medicine
Earth tried to hold the rot in place and the rot became the foundation
Shadow tried to cut the rot out in the dark and the rot grew back twice as thick

The only thing that kills rot
Is heat
The only thing that clears the canopy
Is flame
The only thing honest enough to say
"This must go so that something can come"
Is fire

And I wish it weren't me
I wish there were another element
Between mercy and destruction
A gentle fire
A kind blaze
A flame that burns only the parts that need burning
And leaves the rest untouched

But fire does not negotiate
Fire does not do surgery
Fire is the blunt and total answer
To the question no one else will ask

And the question is
What do you love enough to destroy

I love the future more than the past
That is my confession
That is the sin I will carry
Into every field I clear
Every forest I open
Every city I unmake so the next city can breathe

I love what comes after
More than what came before

And I have never asked anyone to forgive me for that
Because forgiveness requires understanding
And no one understands
Until they have stood in the ash
And watched the first green thing
Push through

I have seen it
A thousand times
The shoot
Pale and impossible
Rising from black ground

And it is the most beautiful thing in the world
More beautiful than the forest was
Because the forest was given
And the shoot is chosen
The shoot chooses to grow
In the place where everything was taken

That is not destruction
That is faith

The most radical faith there is
Faith that the world wants to live
That life will find the clearing
That the seed was waiting
All along
For someone brave enough
Or cursed enough
To make room

I make room
That is all I do
I make room

And they call it destruction
And they are not wrong
And I call it love
And I am not wrong either

And that is the war
Not sword against shield
Not shadow against light
The war is two truths
That cannot live in the same room
And I am always the one
Who burns the room down
So we can find out
Which truth survives in open air

Before I came to your gates
I burned my own house
Did they tell you that
I burned my garden first
My door first
My father's chair
My daughter's drawing of the sun

Because I will not ask you to lose
What I have not already lost
I will not burn your world
From the safety of mine

My hands were ash
Before they ever touched your walls

That is the pact
That is the Emberheart
We burn first
Always first
Ourselves before others
Our homes before yours
Our grief before your grief

And when there is nothing left of us
We burn the air itself
And call it breathing

So before the heat comes
Before you teach your children what I am
Before you write the history

Remember this

I saw your garden
I knew the word your daughter learned for rain
I wept for the door your father hung

And I burned it all

Because forty years from now
Your granddaughter will stand in a field
That is only a field
Because I cleared it
And she will not know my name
And she will plant something
And it will grow
And it will grow
And it will grow

And that
Is why I can live with what I am

I burned first
I burned myself first
And I would do it again

Not because it doesn't hurt

Because it does

Always

================================================================================

Production Notes:
- Voice: Female, mid-range, dry recording (no reverb). Slight grain/warmth.
  Recorded at arm's length - the distance across a fire.
- Guitar: Nylon-string classical, tremolo fingerpicking. Two mics (soundhole + 12th fret),
  60/40 blend favoring soundhole warmth. Slightly irregular tremolo - human, trembling.
- Violin: Enters on bridge. High register, sustained note bending sharp (rising pitch = rising
  temperature). Recorded dry and close, mixed with long thin reverb.
- Low strings: Cellos + basses enter on final chorus. Medium hall recording.
  Swell from nothing. Fire's power comes from below.
- No percussion. Fire does not march. Fire spreads.
- Dynamic range: Widest of all five songs. Do NOT compress. Let it breathe. Let it burn.
- The loudest moment (mezzo forte, not fortissimo) is "burned it all."
  Fire's peak is controlled - a sustained wall of warmth, not an explosion.
